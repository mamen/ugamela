# What is ugamela?

ugamela is a open-source clone of the popular browsergame ogame, developed by the Gameforge 4D GmbH. It first appeared around the year 2006, when Peberos published the source-code for his version of ugamela. It stayed open-source until the version 0.2-r13, which can still be found for download. After this, Peberos continued to improve ugamela as a closed-source browsergame.

Now, many years later, ugamela is back, redone completely from scratch with the latest web-technologies available. Its goal is to be as close to the original ogame (also known as ogame classic) as possible.

# Disclaimer

This open-source project is still in an alpha-state, **please do not use this in an production-environment**. Currently, not many features are available and this game is not fully playable. Feel free to contribute by making a pull-request.
